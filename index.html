                    This is the start of my quarantine and my plans to move out 
                    of London before the cases of COVID-19 have accelerated rapidly.

                <h3>Why Did You Create this Blog?</h3>

                <p>
                    The idea of this blog was origenally created as a project 
                    for my web development class however, the creation of this
                    blog has given me structure in my day because I need to work on the code.
